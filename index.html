I always knew I'd find you, to be here is worth the wait to
I'm not lying when I say, "I've been stuck by the glue onto you"
I've been stuck by glue
Right onto you
I've been stuck by glue
I've never known
I've never known someone like you
I've never known
I've never known someone like youI've never known someone like you
Tangled in love, stuck by you from the glue
Don't forget to kiss me or else you'll have to miss me
I guess I'm stuck forever by the glue, oh, and you
You've been hiding in plain sight, and it appeared, oh I know
Loving you once only feels wrong, I need you
I always knew I'd find you, to be here is worth the wait to
I'm not lying when I say, "I've been stuck by the glue onto you"
I've been stuck by glue
